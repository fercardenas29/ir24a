      "Recipe Title: Deluxe Corned Beef Hash\n",
      "Description: This corned beef hash combines cooked corned beef with crispy potatoes and onions for a delicious way to use up leftover St. Paddy's Day corned beef.\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons butter\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n",
      "- 1 large onion, chopped\n",
      "- 5 large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes\n",
      "- 1 large carrot, coarsely shredded\n",
      "- 2 pounds cooked corned beef, cubed\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n",
      "- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste\n",
      "- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme leaves\n",
      "- 1 pinch salt to taste\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Put your leftover corned beef to good use with this satisfying, hearty, and absolutely delicious corned beef hash recipe.\n",
      "2. Corned beef hash is a hearty Irish meal made with potatoes and corned beef. The ingredients are traditionally pan-fried until they are tender and warm. Corned beef hash is a popular use for leftover corned beef (think the day after St. Patrick's Day).\n",
      "3. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make corned beef hash at home:\n",
      "4. This versatile dish works well for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. If you're serving it in the morning, consider pairing it with traditional Irish breakfast fare: sausage, eggs, and beans. Corned beef hash is often topped with a poached or fried egg.\n",
      "5. It also pairs perfectly with traditional Irish side dishes, such as Irish soda bread and colcannon.\n",
      "6. Store your leftover corned beef hash in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave, on the stove, or in the oven. You can freeze corned beef hash for up to three months. It won't be as crisp after thawing, but it should retain its delicious flavor.\n",
      "7. \"Delicious,\" according to Maya J. \"I had left over corned beef from earlier in the week and this was a great way to use it up. The herbs added a good savory taste to a traditional dish; I did use fresh herbs.\"\n",
      "8. \"This was great and the whole family enjoyed it,\" raves Doug. \"The only change I made was to add some cooked ham since I didn't have quite enough corned beef, but it was very flavorful. I will make this again.\"\n",
      "9. \"I made this with the leftover corned beef from St. Patty's Day dinner,\" says RGRLFRI. \"It is absolutely delicious. Top this tasty dish off with eggs over easy and your tastebuds will be dancing with joy!\"\n",
      "10. Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n",
      "11. Gather all ingredients.\n",
      "12. Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until lightly browned, about 8 minutes.\n",
      "13. Stir in potatoes and carrot; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 15 minutes.\n",
      "14. Stir in corned beef, parsley, pepper, thyme, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until hash is crisp and browned, 10 to 15 more minutes.\n",
      "15. Serve and enjoy!\n",
