Banana Banana Bread (with Video),"This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana flavor. Why compromise the banana flavor? Friends and family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted. Enjoy!","['2 cups all-purpose flour', '1 teaspoon baking soda', '0.25 teaspoon salt', '0.75 cup brown sugar', '0.5 cup butter', '2 eggs, beaten', '2.3333332538605 cups mashed overripe bananas']","['Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.', 'Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth.

Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.']"
Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake,"This wonderfully rich, silky dessert is an ideal choice when you're entertaining a group of friends. Featuring a hazelnut shortbread crust that provides a crisp based for the moist, airy mousse, it is simple to prepare, can be made ahead of time, and does not require any last-minute fussing. Nutella -- beloved by Europeans (and by more Americans than admit to it) -- acts as a stealth ingredient that both echoes and enhances the marriage of the crust and the mousse. So whether you find yourself with or without a Valentine this year, it will be love at first bite. -- Lawrence Karol","['2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off', '3 tablespoons sugar', '0.5 cup all-purpose flour', '0.25 cup unsalted butter, softened', '2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder', '0.125 teaspoon salt', '1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin', '3 tablespoons cold water', '0.5 cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella', '0.5 cup mascarpone', '1.5 cups chilled heavy cream', '2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder', '3 tablespoons sugar', '5 tablespoons heavy cream', '3.5 ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped']","['For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom), then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of parchment paper.', 'Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter, cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms.', 'Press dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread base.', 'Make mousse while shortbread cools: Sprinkle gelatin over water in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat gelatin mixture over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is melted, about 2 minutes. Whisk in chocolate hazelnut spread until combined and remove from heat.', 'Whisk together mascarpone and chocolate hazelnut mixture in a large bowl. Beat together cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in another large bowl with an electric mixer at low speed until just combined, then increase speed to high and beat until cream just holds soft peaks. Whisk one third of whipped cream into mascarpone mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream until well combined. Spoon filling onto shortbread base in pan, gently smoothing top, then chill, covered, at least 3 hours.', 'Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes.', 'Run a warm thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing excess ganache to drip down sides.']"
Chef John's Strawberry Semifreddo,"My lighter, no-cook adaptation of semifreddo skips the traditional egg custard and cuts down on fat, sugar, and time. It just so happens to be lighter, with a cleaner, more distinct berry flavor and a texture that's less creamy than classic semifreddo, falling somewhere between strawberry ice cream and a strawberry ice pop.","['1 pound fresh strawberries', '0.5 cup white sugar', '0.75 cup full-fat Greek yogurt', 'lemon, zested', '2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice', '0.125 teaspoon vanilla extract', '1 teaspoon aged balsamic vinegar', '1 pinch salt', '1.75 cups cold heavy cream', '6 shortbread cookies', '3 tablespoons melted butter', '1.5 cups diced fresh strawberries', '2 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste']","['Line 10 ramekins with plastic wrap and place them onto a baking sheet.', 'Hull strawberries with the tip of a knife. Place strawberries in a food processor. Add sugar, Greek yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle in a tiny pinch of salt. Pulse on and off to combine; finish pureeing on high until smooth.', 'Whisk heavy cream in a bowl until soft peaks form. Add the strawberry puree. Stir and fold with a spatula until most of the major streaks disappear. Fill ramekins 1/4 to 1/8 inch from the top with the strawberry mixture. Tap baking sheet against the counter to settle the tops. Cover ramekins in plastic wrap and freeze until mostly firm, about 1 1/2 hours.', 'Meanwhile, place cookies in a resealable plastic bag. Seal; crush cookies through with a rolling pin to get 1 1/2 cups of crumbs. Place crumbs into a bowl; add butter and mix well.', 'Divide the cookie crumb mixture among the ramekins and smooth out with the back of a spoon. Cover again and freeze until completely frozen, about 2 hours.', 'Toss diced strawberries with sugar in a bowl. Let rest at room temperature until a syrup forms below the strawberries, about 1 hour.', 'Warm up each ramekin in your hands to help unmold the semifreddo; invert onto a plate. Top with the strawberries in syrup. Thaw for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.']"
Peach and Goat Cheese Tartine,"For me, this is summer on a slice of bread. August is national goat cheese month (no, I don't know who decides these things), and what better way to enjoy chevre than by topping it with sweet, ripe, impossibly juicy peach slices? Mix in a little thyme and black pepper to keep things interesting, and you're looking at a very special treat.","['2 (1 inch thick) slices French bread, toasted', '2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed', '4 ounces fresh goat cheese, softened', '2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, or to taste', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste', '6 fresh peach slices']","['Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven&#39;s broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.', 'Place toast on prepared baking sheet and drizzle each side with about 1 teaspoon olive oil.', 'Stir goat cheese, thyme, pepper together in a bowl until soft and spreadable.', 'Spread cheese mixture on each piece of toast all the way to the edges so entire piece is covered.', 'Top each toast with 3 peach slices; drizzle remaining olive oil and sprinkle salt over the top.', 'Broil in the preheated oven until tops and edges are lightly browned and cheese and peaches are warmed through, about 2 minutes.']"
Peach Brulee Burrata Bruschetta,"A slice of toast with a schmear of Burrata is already a beautiful thing, but when you add a nice pinch of Herbes de Provence salt, then a slice of peach brulee, you are talking about a whole new level of beautiful. This is perfect for any kind of entertaining that occurs while fresh peaches are still in season.","['1 teaspoon herbes de Provence', '1 teaspoon sea salt', '12 slices Italian bread, toasted', '6 ounces Burrata cheese', '1 large fresh freestone peach, cut into 12 slices', '2 tablespoons turbinado sugar']","['Stir together herbes de Provence and sea salt in a small bowl. Set aside.', 'Top each slice toasted bread with a generous spread of Burrata cheese. Sprinkle cheese with a pinch of the herbes de Provence sea salt mixture. Set aside.', 'Lay peach slices flat in a single layer on a flame-proof surface or plate. Lightly sprinkle each slice with turbinado sugar. Using a kitchen torch set to a medium-low flame, melt the sugar by making short, even passes over the top of the sugar. Continue melting the sugar until it bubbles and turns dark brown, about 30 seconds. Place peach slice on each piece of toast and serve.']"
